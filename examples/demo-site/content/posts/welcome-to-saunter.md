Welcome to Saunter, an editorial-style Hugo theme designed specifically for Micro.blog. This theme combines clean typography with modern design patterns to create a beautiful reading experience.

## Features

Saunter includes everything you need for a modern blog:

- **Editorial card layout** that makes your content shine
- **Dark mode support** that respects system preferences
- **Category badges** for easy content organization
- **Built-in search** integration with Micro.blog
- **Newsletter integration** for building your audience
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices

## Design Philosophy

The theme draws inspiration from editorial design, focusing on readability and visual hierarchy. Each post is presented as a card, giving your content room to breathe while maintaining a cohesive layout.
